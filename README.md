# Assignment 13 - E6 Refactor

**Kayce Georgi**

I had the hardest time with this assignment! Specifically, the async/await and destructuring.

Destructuring, it took me until about the 3rd watch-through of the office hours video (where you destructured the OMDB API) to understand what to do when trying to call an API. Otherwise, I didn't know what to set the const's to, since there was no named object in the code.

As for async/await, I was able to follow along when you answered questions in the office hours video, however, I still don't quite understand exactly WHAT I did. My question here, we seem to be getting rid of a .then altogether - in this code, line 37 used to be wrapped in a .then command, but now it just sits on it's own. Why don't we tell the code to wait until the response is converted to JSON to start messing in it? How come this can work instantaneously? 

Otherwise, the other conversions all seemed to make sense!
